# Track_Phone
Programa Python (Programador : Joel Malacas)

This server program to locate cell phones by cell phone number.

To begin with, if you don't even have python and the libraries installed and you're using windows, then run the "install_all.bat" file.

If you have python, but don't have the libraries, then just run the "install.bat" file.

Then, to run the program, run the file "track_phone.py" and enter the number. 

Then it will locate the number and save it in the .txt file and will generate in the html file:: "mylocation.html" the GPS with the coordinates of the entered number

I'm a new Portuguese programmer, and I hope you enjoy this program. 

Write any useful reviews, to evolve.

Thank you
